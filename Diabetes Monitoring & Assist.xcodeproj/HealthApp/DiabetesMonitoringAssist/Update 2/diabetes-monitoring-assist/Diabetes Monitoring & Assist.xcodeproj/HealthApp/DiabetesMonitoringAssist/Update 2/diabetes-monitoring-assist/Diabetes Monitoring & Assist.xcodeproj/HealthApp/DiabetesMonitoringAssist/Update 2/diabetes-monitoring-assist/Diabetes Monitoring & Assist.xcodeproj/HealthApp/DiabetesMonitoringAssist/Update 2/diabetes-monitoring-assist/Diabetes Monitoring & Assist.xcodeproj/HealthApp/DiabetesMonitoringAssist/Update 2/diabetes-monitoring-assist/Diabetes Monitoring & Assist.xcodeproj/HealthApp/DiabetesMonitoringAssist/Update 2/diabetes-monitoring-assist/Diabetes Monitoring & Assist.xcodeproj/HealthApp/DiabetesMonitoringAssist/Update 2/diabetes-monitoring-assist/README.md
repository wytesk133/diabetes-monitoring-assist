# Diabetes Monitoring & Assist
_A project in the Winter 2019 offering of CS 125 (Next Generation Search Systems) at the University of California, Irvine_

## About the Project
Our group has developed a mobile application that will help diabetic individuals keep track of the their food intake and exercise. The applicationâ€™s goal is to be able to suggest healthy recipes and workout schedules for the individual based on research specifically done for diabetics. We have chosen to tackle this problem because diabetes is a huge problem in the United States and a worldwide epidemic. [Statistics](https://www.diabetesdaily.com/learn-about-diabetes/what-is-diabetes/how-many-people-have-diabetes/) has shown that 1 in 11 adults have diabetes; that accounts to over 415 million people. We hope that with our application can help improve the lives of people living with this condition.
